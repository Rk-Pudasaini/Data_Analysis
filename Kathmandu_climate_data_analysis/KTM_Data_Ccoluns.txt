Kathmandu Daily Climate Data (1982 -2023)
Kathmandu City Daily Climate Data from 1982 to 2023


The dataset contains data on Kathmandu's climate on different parameters. These data were obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) POWER Project funded through the NASA Earth Science/Applied Science Program extracted from Data Access Viewer API.

The data is extracted based on the latitude and longitude of kathmandu
